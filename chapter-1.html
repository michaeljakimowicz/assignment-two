        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
        <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
        </p>
        <p>&#34;My dear Mr. Bennet,&#34; said his lady to him one day, &#34;have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last&#63;&#34;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
        <p>&#34;But it is,&#34; returned she&#59; &#34;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.&#34;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
        <p>&#34;Do you not want to know who has taken it&#63;&#34; cried his wife impatiently.</p>
        <p>&#34;You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&#34;</p>
